# Software Engineering Recap
A curated repository of data structures, algorithms, and LeetCode solutions implemented in multiple programming languages such as JavaScript, Ruby, and more.

The goal of this project is to serve as a reference and learning hub for anyone looking to strengthen their problem-solving skills, revisit computer science fundamentals, or prepare for technical interviews.

## ðŸ“š Contents

- Data Structures
  - Stacks & Queues

## ðŸ›  Languages

- JavaScript
- Ruby

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/ehwreck/software-engineering-recap.git
cd software-engineering-recap
```
2. Navigate into the language or topic folder youâ€™re interested in.
3. Run the solutions locally (example for Node.js):
```zsh
node arrays/two-sum.js
```
4. Or for Ruby:
```zsh
ruby arrays/two_sum.rb
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Build a reusable library of common data structures and algorithms.
- Provide clean and idiomatic solutions across multiple languages.
- Help others (and myself) practice and review core computer science concepts.
- Serve as an interview prep reference.
